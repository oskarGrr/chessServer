# Multithreaded chess server made in C and using the winsock API

## overview
This is the chess server that goes with the [chess desktop application that I made in C++](https://github.com/oskarGrr/MultiplayerChess). 


## build inscructions
For now the server only works on windows so I have just included a visual studio project.
It should be as simple as oppening the .sln and pressing F5.
